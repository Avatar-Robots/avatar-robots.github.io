title: Poses
subtitle: 'We evaluated the performance of the three solvers through a set of 12 static poses. Poses are chosen in group, with each group representative of one partition of the space of all possible robot arm poses. Poses 1 to 3 covers the general case of hands up, and vary in whether the hand points forward, upright, or backward; Likewise, poses 9 to 11 covers the case of hands down; Poses 5 to 8 covers different cases where the arms are in front of the body; Poses 4 and 12 are the standard T-pose and A-pose.
